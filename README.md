# US Population & Electoral College

This project aims to look at the relationship between US electoral college votes and population historically

# Data

The data are from [electoral college wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) and [census population wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_historical_population).

To run the script:

```bash
python scripts/scrap_us_census_pop.py
```

```bash
python scripts/scrap_electoral_college_data.py
```

# Visualization
